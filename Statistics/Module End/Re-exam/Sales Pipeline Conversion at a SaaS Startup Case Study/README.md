# Business problem: sales pipeline conversion at a SaaS startup

This assignment is about a case study about TechnoServe, a fictional tech SaaS (Software as a
service) startup that specializes in different types of cloud-based software services to the small
and medium enterprise customers. The products provided by the company are inclined towards
increasing the productivity for the customers.
The revenue that the company generates is highly dependent on the consumption of the cloud
services that they provide. Therefore, the revenue in-flow in the company is highly dependent on
the number of clients that the company has. The company is facing a very pertinent problem
faced in the IT industry today, declining conversions across its sales funnel.
The problem that the company is facing is that its pipeline conversion percentage has dropped
from 35% at the end of the last fiscal (FY 2019-20) to 25% at present. The company needs a
solution to solve the issue, and they have asked you to come up with one.
Here are a few details about TechnoServe that you should be aware of:
The company is based out of Pune and started its operations in 2010.
It has clients spread over Pune and other cities as well.
There are more than 600 employees, distributed over multiple teams.
It has a wide variety of IT solutions spread across different industries.

# Problem Statement

Understand the problem, come up with possible hypotheses for low conversions faced by
TechnoServe. Once that is done, you need to analyze the dataset given below to validate the
hypotheses and form the solution strategy that they should employ to solve the problem.
The dataset and the data dictionary are given below.

# Hypotheses:

- The decline in conversions may be attributed to several factors:
Lead Quality: Reduced lead quality could stem from unfocused marketing or shifts in the target
audience.

- Sales Process Inefficiencies: Delays, inadequate engagement, or impersonal communication
might hinder conversions.

- Competition Impact: Elevated competition could drive customers to explore multiple options.

- Product-Market Fit: A mismatch between services and customer needs could dampen interest.

- Economic Factors: Economic uncertainties might lead to delayed decisions.

- Geographical Variance: Different conversion rates across cities could point to location-specific
dynamics.
